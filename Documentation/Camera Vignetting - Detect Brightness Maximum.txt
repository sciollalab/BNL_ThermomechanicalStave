DETECT BRIGHTNESS MAXIMUM
Primary Author: Catherine Nicoloff (cnicolof@wellesley.edu)

Core concept:  Using the brightest spot in the field of view and a progression of thresholds, attempt to determine whether the camera is aligned with a flat field of view.

Design Philosophy:  

This VI may require occasional configuration from the user for best performance.

If necessary, this SubVI can be opened during operation to display several tabs of debugging information as well as editable parameters.

This SubVI can also be run in stand-alone mode for testing by specifying a static image file to load from disk, provided no input image refnum is supplied.

-----
Structure:

* Bright Spot Centering tab:  Displays the image from the camera, overlaid with crosshairs indicating the image center and a bullseye indicating the center of the brightest region in the image.  

If Refnum In is wired, the image displayed will be the input image.  This will ordinarily be wired to accept a single frame from the camera.

If Refnum In is blank and File Path is valid, the VI will attempt to use the specified static image.  This is useful for unit testing and debugging.

	* Bullseye Color: The color of the bullseye overlay. 

	* Center Color: The color of the center crosshair overlay. 

* Progressive Threshold tab:  Displays the results of a progressive series of thresholds applied to the original image.

	* Step Size: Set to 8 by default.  Step the threshold from image mean to Threshold Max by the given interval.

	* Min. Objects:  Set to 250 by default.  The minimum number of objects necessary before attempting to fit an ellipse.

	* Threshold Max:  Set to 255 by default.  The maximum threshold value to step to.  Use caution with this setting, as threshold values that are too high may create a false impression of misalignment.

* Visualize Ellipses tab:  Displays the camera image and the full set of detected objects for each threshold step.

	* Radius:  Set to 8 by default.  Radius of the overlay circles that mark the found objects.

	* Draw Mode:  Set to Fill by default.  Options are Fill or Frame.  Whether to fill the overlay circles (default) or just draw the frame.

	* Object Display:  Set to OFF (Fit) by default.  Options are Fit or All.  Draw just the objects used by the ellipse fit (Fit) or draw all the found objects (All).

* Graphs tab:  Displays three graphs to show the evolution of ellipse eccentricity and ellipse center coordinates with increasing threshold values.
